    """
    Build a rustworkx undirected graph from the backend's coupling map.

    If multigraph=True then parallel edges in the coupling map will produce parallel edges in the
    constructed graph.
    For example, if both [1, 2] and [2, 1] are in the coupling map, then the graph will contain two
    edges between the nodes labeled 1 and 2.

    The graph's edges are labeled with the coupling edge. So, the two edges from the previous
    example will be labeled [1, 2] and [2, 1].

    If multigraph=False then parallel edges will produce a single edge in the graph; the node order
    in the edge's label will be arbitrary.

    Nodes in the line graph are connected by an (unlabeled) edge iff the original edges share a node

    Example: if the original graph has four nodes and edges [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]
    then the line graph has three nodes labeled [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]
    and two edges: between the nodes labeled [0, 1] and the node labeled [1, 2]; and between the

    - Each node label is encapsulated in a singleton list. This is in order to be consistent with
      groups of multiple nodes, like groups of edges.
    - Each group of nodes constitutes a list.
    - We return the list of groups. For example: [[[0], [2]], [[1]]] means two groups, one of nodes
      0 and 2 and the other group contains only node 1.

    # - We construct the line graph of the input graph. In the line graph,
    #   every node represents an edge of the original graph. Nodes in the line graph
    #   are connected by an edge if the respective edges in the original graph share at least
    #   one node.
    # - We construct the distance graph of the line graph. The nodes of the distance graph are the
    #   same as in the line graph. Two nodes are connected by an edge if the distance between them
    #   in the line graph is smaller than `distance`.
    # - We color the nodes of the distance graph (coloring a graph means that adjacent
    #   nodes are assigned different colors). This induces a coloring to the edges of the
    #   original graph that satisfies the distance constraint.
